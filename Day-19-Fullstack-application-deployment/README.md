---

# 📦 AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

AWS ECR is used to store Docker images.

## Workflow

```text
Docker Build
   ↓
Docker Tag
   ↓
Push Image to AWS ECR
   ↓
Kubernetes Pulls Image from ECR
```

## Benefits

- Secure image storage
- AWS-native integration
- Private repositories
- Image versioning
- Scalable container registry

---

# 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins

Jenkins automates the build and deployment workflow.

## Jenkins Pipeline Stages

# 🎓 Interview Explanation

## ✅ Explain Your Project in Interview

I worked on deploying a Full Stack Application using DevOps and Kubernetes technologies.

The infrastructure was provisioned using Terraform on AWS, where resources such as VPCs, EKS clusters, IAM roles, and ECR repositories were created.

Applications were containerized using Docker and deployed into Kubernetes clusters running on AWS EKS.

Jenkins was used to automate CI/CD pipelines for building Docker images and pushing them into AWS ECR.

Argo CD was implemented for GitOps-based continuous deployment into Kubernetes.

Ingress Controller handled external routing while Kubernetes managed scaling, networking, and high availability.

The project followed production-grade deployment practices with automation, scalability, and secure architecture.
